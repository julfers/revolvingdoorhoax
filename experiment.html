<h1 class="title">The experiment</h1>
<p>This experiment intends to answer, in a manner accessible to average door users, whether their
choice of a revolving door versus regular might justifiably be thought to reduce energy consumption.</p>
<p>Basically, this uses a small-scale model of a building equipped with both a revolving door and a
swinging door. The heated tiny building sits inside a climactic chamber, that is, a freezer, and
automatically opens its doors in proportion to a rate of traffic.</p>
<p>By measuring the drop in temperature caused by different numbers of simulated people arriving, we
should see whether, all else equal, the revolving door expends less heat.</p>
<p><em>Model construction and programming is still in progress, more details to follow</em></p>
<p>You can run an in-browser demo at <a class="reference external" href="model.html">model.html</a></p>
