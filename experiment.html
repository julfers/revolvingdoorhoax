<h1>The experiment<a class="headerlink" href="#the-experiment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/img/model-wide.jpg"><img alt="Wide view of revolving door model" src="_images/model-wide-small.jpg" /></a>
<p>This experiment intends to answer, in a manner accessible to average door users, whether their
choices of a revolving door versus regular might justifiably be thought to reduce energy
consumption.</p>
<p>The experiment uses a heated tiny building that automatically opens its doors in proportion to a
rate of traffic. By measuring the drop in temperature caused by different numbers of simulated
people arriving, we should see whether, all else equal, the revolving door expends less heat.</p>
<div class="section" id="construction">
<h2>Construction<a class="headerlink" href="#construction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/img/exterior-schematic.jpg"><img alt="Exterior door position schematic" src="_images/exterior-schematic-small.jpg" /></a>
<p>This model is approximately one foot on each side, built mostly from medium-density fiberboard,
3/4-inch for walls and 1/4-inch for a revolving door and a swinging door, placed approximately
equidistant from the building center.</p>
<div class="section" id="interior">
<h3>Interior<a class="headerlink" href="#interior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each wall is a 12 by 12 inch square, making the building slightly oblong. Inside, two sensors lie
six and seven inches from the interior front wall.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/img/model-inside.jpg"><img alt="Interior model picture" src="_images/model-inside-small.jpg" /></a>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/img/interior-schematic.jpg"><img alt="Interior model schematic" src="_images/interior-schematic-small.jpg" /></a>
<p>Two light bulbs provide heat for the building; they remain on throughout the experiment so a
constant amount of energy flows into the model. Between the heaters and the sensors, a quarter-inch
fiberboard barrier blocks direct incandescent heat, but allows air flow through half-inch gap at the
bottom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="revolving-door-enclosure">
<h3>Revolving door enclosure<a class="headerlink" href="#revolving-door-enclosure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For the revolving door enclosure, the model uses 4-inch PVC pipe. Since the reference full-sized
door wings were 3 by 7 feet each, this dictates 1/18 scale, making each wing 2 inches by 4 and 5/8
inches.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/img/revolver-enclosure-schematic.jpg"><img alt="Revolving door enclosure schematic" src="_images/revolver-enclosure-schematic-small.jpg" /></a>
<p>On each side of the enclosure, a 90-degree opening allows virtual traffic through the door. The
enclosure is slightly taller for stability, leaving a half-inch lip on the top and a quarter-inch
lip on the bottom.</p>
<p>A plug made from three layers of quarter-inch fiberboard covers the top of the enclosure. The lower
to layers fit into the enclosure while the half-inch wider top layer prevents the plug from slipping
too far in.</p>
<p>Another plug, this time one layer, fits into the bottom of the door enclosure, and the enclosure, in
turn, fits into a circular opening in the quarter-inch fiberboard that represents the building’s
floor, which in turn rests on the 3/4-inch fiberboard ground. A hole through these lower pieces
provides for the door’s axle.</p>

<div class="section" id="revolving-door-and-axle">
<h3>Revolving door and axle<a class="headerlink" href="#revolving-door-and-axle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The model uses a four-winged revolving door, made by slotting two pieces of fiberboard together.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/img/revolver-schematic.jpg"><img alt="Revolving door schematic" src="_images/revolver-schematic-small.jpg" /></a>
<p>The slightly wider slot in the bottom of the door pieces allows the door to couple to its drive
axle via a nylon spacer; the axle itself, a zinc rod, pressure-fits into the spacer and extends
below the ground, where another nylon spacer couples it to the stepper motor.</p>
<p>Tolerances around the door are approximately 1/16 inch, due more to my carpentry skill than design.
By fortuitous coincidence, this turns out to be approximately in scale with the gaps around the
full-sized revolving door wings used as a reference.</p>
<p>To keep the centered, the door uses a 4d finish nail’s tip as its top axle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="swinging-door">
<h3>Swinging door<a class="headerlink" href="#swinging-door" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The swinging door is the same size as one wing of the revolving door, matching the swinging doors
installed beside the revolving door in the real-world office building used as a reference.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/img/swinger-schematic.jpg"><img alt="Swinging door schematic" src="_images/swinger-schematic-small.jpg" /></a>
<p>A small notch at the bottom of the swinging door leaves room for the servo arm to glue to the
swinging door, thus coupling directly to the servo.</p>

<h2>Programming<a class="headerlink" href="#programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The whole thing gets hooked up to an Arduino. It has a Web interface to control it and collect data. The <a class="reference external" href="https://hg.sr.ht/~julfers/revolvingdoorhoax">source code is on Sourcehut</a> and you can pretend you’re controlling the experiment with this in-browser demo:</p>
