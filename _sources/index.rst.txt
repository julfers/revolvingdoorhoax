Imagine, before you, two doors lie in wait, anticipating your choice. One, simple and familiar,
but adorned by an admonishment to use the other. Imagine you do not know how your choice may affect
the world. Is the revolving door an entertaining carousel offering an easy option to save energy or
a rotary menace? Every day, this conundrum faces literally some people, maybe more.

The sign may claim it, but is it true? **Do revolving doors really save energy?**

Reviewing :doc:`existing research <research/index>`, you might be surprised to find that no one has yet set up a simple,
comprehensible experiment to show the difference. A reasonable person might wonder, when it would be
so easy to do, **why has nobody tested the two door types, door to door?**

-   Who benefits from keeping us in the dark?
-   Is it it a coincidence that door companies sell two doors instead of one when someone installs
    a revolver?

For those who struggle with the conflict between love of convenience and duties to sign obedience,
**this site is here to do that test.**

The intuitive case
==================

The `1938 Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning Guide`_ suggests:

    Infiltration rate through swinging and revolving doors is generally a matter of judgment... in
    the absence of adequate research... revolving doors may be assumed 60 per cent of swinging door
    values.

That revolving door estimate probably came from Arthur Simpson, sales manager at the Van Kannel
Revolving door company, but despite the conflict of interest, his intuition seems reasonable.

In climates with winter, most of us users of the indoors have found ourselves uncomfortably near
doors that periodically open to allow unpleasant cold air blasts. It appears sensible to believe
that were the door a revolver, we should be subject to less an invasion of our warm air space, a
line of reasoning that suffers two problems.

First, even if our intuition on drafts is accurate, it hardly follows that the door should permit
less air infiltration overall. Many unfortunate pioneers of flight coult attest that fluid dynamics
is a messy and often unintuitive business.

Second, thanks to sampling bias, we may not even be correct about relative draftiness. We sit beside
many doors, but only notice the drafty handful. Since the world contains fewer rotary doors than the
ordinary type, we're much less likely to sit near the revolvers. The revolvers are also probably
installed in places with more entrance space, further reducing our chances of staying near them long
enough to feeling a draft.

And notice the peculiar similarity between a revolving door and a centrifugal pump:

Finally, if you imagine that the door gets used occasionally, it becomes clear that at rest, it
eventually releases the entire contents of its outer-facing cell to the environment. All that air
previously rested indoors, and it is hard to imagine that a single use of a swinging door should
transfer such a large volume.

The folks at 99 Percent Invisible hold that Van Kannel invented revolving doors to `avoid his
obligation to hold doors for old ladies`_, thus reducing social awkwardness. Few who have
accidentally found themselves sharing a door cell would agree that revolving doors reduce net social
anxiety in the world.
